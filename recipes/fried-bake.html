        <h1>Fried Bake</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour , plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter or margarine- this is totally optional</li>
            <li>1 cup water, plus 1 tablespoon if needed</li>
            <li>2 cups canola or coconut oil for frying the bakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Add butter and mix with a fork or use your fingers until the flour resembles coarse breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Make a hole or well in the center of the flour and start pouring 3/4 cup water while mixing and stirring in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup more water and continue mixing gently for about 5 minutes until you form a nice soft dough.</li>
            <li>If dough is too sticky, dust with a tablespoon of flour, if dough is too dry after adding all the water, add another one tablespoon or so of water and bring the dough together.</li>
            <li>Allow to rest for about 3-5 minutes, then dust with flour and knead to form a smoother dough.</li>
            <li>Rub some oil on top of dough and allow the dough to rest for 25 - 30 minutes covered with plastic wrap or a damp paper or kitchen towel</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 6 or 8 pieces (depending on how large you want the fried bakes to be)</li>
            <li>Roll them into balls and place on a clean, well-floured surface. Allow to rest for at least 10-15 minutes. <strong>covered</strong></li>
            <li>Flatten the balls of dough until they are about 1/4 inch thick, and 5 -6 inches in diameter using your fingers or a rolling pin</li>
            <li>Add oil in a deep pan to a depth of about two inches over medium heat</li>
            <li>When oil is heated through, start adding the rolled out dough to the hot oil</li>
            <li>Turn dough immediately as it's added to the oil , as this will help the bake swell or puff up</li>
            <li>Fry in hot oil until both sides are golden brown, about 30 - 45 seconds per side ,turn over once</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towel so as to eliminate some of the grease from the oil.</li>
            <li>Serve with Fried Salt fish or Fried Shark or anything you fancy.</li>
        </ol>
